## Creating react app

There are multiple ways of creating react app

1. `npx create-react-app project_name`

`npx:` - Node Package Executor
`create-react-app:` - Utility to create new react app

> It is very bulky utility which results into big and heavy bundle size

`package.json` - All metadata like dependencies, scripts and project information

> `npm run start` - run project

> `npm run build` - build project

2. `npm create vite@latest`

after running this command we need to provide project information as below
    - project name
    - framework
    - base language

> need to install node_modules separately using `npm install`

> `npm run dev` - run project

> `npm run build` - build project
